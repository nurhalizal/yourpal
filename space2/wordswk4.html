    <p>In one of my previous pieces, I mentioned about a contact of mine who posts some wisdom words on a daily basis. 
        Ever since I noticed those posts, I’ve always found the words relatable. Like, the words actually hold precious 
        moral lessons within. At times, I even take a screenshot of the post I find highly relatable—I may need to reflect 
        to those words every now and then. So today, I’m gonna talk about one of them which I also took a screenshot of 
        recently.
    </p>
    <p>The post says this, “<em>Happiness comes from ourselves. Do what makes you happy, not what makes you look happy.</em>” I 
        guess once you read this, I don’t even need to explain how much these words can strike into our inner self. As 
        a social being, our interaction with others is a compelling part of our lives, and so is public opinion. We tend 
        to pay big attention to others’ opinion; how people perceive us, their thoughts of us and our actions, and even 
        what they think we feel like. 
    </p>
    <p>Over time, I’m concerned that this one thing has become a universal issue: we pay more attention to how others 
        would think about how we feel rather than focusing on how we really feel. It might be fine if these two separate 
        versions of happiness happen to align. Like, if what people think makes us happy is indeed making us happy, then 
        there’s no problem with that. 
    </p>
    <p>But in reality, this is not always the case. The exact opposite often occurs—or it’s even more common that some don’t 
        actually enjoy what people think they’re enjoying. Even worse, what if there are people who quietly hurt themselves 
        just to create the illusion of being happy. And it’s ironic how some people stick to care more about how people see 
        them than how they actually feel. In this case, we start to rely on others opinion to make us happy—like, “If they 
        think I’m happy, then yes I am.” If this kind of social phenomenon continues on and on, we will eventually create 
        some sort of ‘standards’ for people to be considered happy. As a result, people will do anything to reach that 
        standard regardless of how that actually make them feel inside. But wait,.. or hasn’t it already started now? 
    </p>
    <p>Back to the words I mentioned earlier, it reads as a gentle reminder for all of us. Feeling truly <i>is</i> a 
        complicated thing, yet I’m sure the truest of it comes from within ourselves. The post I mentioned kind of reassures 
        me as well that being happy in my own way is the true happiness. No matter what other says or thinks of us, let’s 
        all find joy in our own ways. <em>What’s the point of being seen happy if we’re hurting inside?</em>
    </p>
    <p>Ps: Some time ago, I felt really mad to hear a short sentence someone said to me. I was sitting alone waiting to 
        go home after class which I enjoyed, then someone I know walked past me. He said a few word; short question that 
        I answered shortly, then he continued by ‘commenting.’ More or less, he said that it’s not fun just constantly 
        doing one thing people assume I do all the time—which I’m actually fond of. It sort of hurts me—as if a part of 
        my way of living my best life is dismissed as boring. 
    </p>
    <p>That moment made me realize that people have different definitions of fun and joy.
