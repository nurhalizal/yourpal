    <p>By the time I’m writing this, I’m currently in the middle of my term break. It also means that most of my friends 
        have gone back to their hometowns for the break. One of them had just left a week ago via sea travel all by herself. 
        While she was at the seaport, she texted me saying she wanted to tell a story or something. Reading that, I instantly 
        thought she’s gonna start share a narrative story, but guess what? The next thing she said was, “Seems like I’m 
        always protected by my parents’ prayers.” 
    </p>
    <p>I certainly didn’t expect that at all. Turned out, she wanted to tell me that she felt like she’s surrounded by nice 
        people, even if they’re strangers—all the time. Apparently, she was getting really nice treatments from strangers at 
        the seaport, and she realized that the same good thing had always happened to her. I was genuinely touched by her 
        story that I even shed a little tear. 
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, I found myself pondering about the sentence she said that I quoted above. We’re likely not always aware of 
        it, but I guess almost every one of us relate to those words. 
    </p>
    <p>Generally, one starts this life as a baby who grows older and older under the great care of their parents. As a baby 
        or little kid, we were constantly being watched or guarded by other people—for most, those were their parents. Then, 
        at some point in life, one will become mature enough for their parents to let them go—giving them more independence. 
    </p>
    <p>But even so, I’m convinced that letting us experience things on our own doesn’t necessarily mean our parents have 
        stopped ‘protecting’ us. As a believer, I’m sure they still do, don’t they? Just not directly. Instead, they’re 
        protecting us through their prayers. Every time we walk out of our home by ourselves, we never know what’s ahead of 
        us to face on our own. I don’t know about others, but I personally feel like everything has a way to work out for 
        the best. At times, we even may meet incredibly good people, good opportunities, or even get away of troubles out 
        there. And I suppose, in all those good things that happen, there’s our parents’ prayers within. 
    </p>
    <p>Ultimately, I’m convinced that they may cut the cord to let us experience and grow more, yet they never really 
        leave us; they sent their prayers every second.
