    <p>One of the most surprising joys in my day-to-day life is words of wisdom that I didn’t see was coming. 
        Apparently, a class is one place to discover those ‘gems’. Just recently, I was attending one of my classes 
        when my lecturer uttered wise lines. The lecture was about something not particularly easy to study—probably 
        not even enjoyable by some. Yeah, I study physics, no wonder if lots of people don’t find my class cosy. 
    </p>
    <p>However, I enjoyed the class pretty well. The way my lecturer explained the material was detailed and clear. 
        Well, that’s if we do pay neat attention, haha. The class went well. I paid attention but was still quite 
        chill that I talked to my friends at times. Not loudly, of course. As the class was coming to an end for the day, 
        I was hit by some words from my lecturer. Here’s the story. He gave us examples of questions he might put in 
        our quizzes or exams. Then, I may not quote it entirely correct, but he said something like this, “…I’m basically 
        giving the exact tips/cues you’ll need if I give you tasks or quizzes, but still, there’s no guarantee that you 
        all are gonna score high marks.” Even just to that point, those words already struck a chord in me, and he didn’t 
        stop there. He continued by mentioning that the similar concept applies in the context of this life too. As a 
        person who has faith in religion, we know that our religion gave us the perfect guide. For us, as Muslims, it’s 
        the Quran. Nevertheless, it’s not guaranteed that everyone will reach the good end in a perfect way as guided. 
        Hearing that, I was totally impressed. It sounds like something I never intended to listen to, but actually needed 
        to hear. Those words were genuinely relatable and obviously need to be held in mind deeply.  
    </p>
    <p>Now I realized that the science of the lecture wasn’t the only thing that intrigued me, the extra lecture struck 
        me in an unexpected way.
