    <p>This is just my second piece of words worth keeping piece. Just like the first one, I got this one from a 
        class as well. It was during one of my Monday classes for this term, just about two weeks ago. My professor in 
        the class likes to teach by a few methods; giving us chances to ask, giving explanations, and sometimes by 
        asking us some questions. On the Monday I’m talking about, she started asking us questions quite early into 
        the class. There was a question/problem that apparently no one really answered correctly. So, she gave us a 
        chance to discuss in a group of two or three. I was sitting in the front row with a friend on my right side, 
        and no one on my left. Actually, there was but quite far from my seat ‘cause the class was not that full. 
        We were given like ten minutes to discuss, so I did discuss with my friend next to me and also talked to my 
        friends behind.
    </p>
    <p>As the time was up, my professor invited us to briefly present our explanation as discussed. She also mentioned 
        about giving extra points for the ones who will present. After some time, one of my friends’ groups stood up and 
        presented their answered. Following the end of that first group’s short presentation, my teammate seemed eager 
        for us to present. Since we were sitting exactly in front of our professor, our actions were clearly visible 
        to her. 
    </p>
    <p>Honestly, I didn’t really want to present. I’m the type of person in class who sometimes just feels like, 
        “Just let others stand up or speak for now.” And yes, I was thinking that way too at the moment. But something 
        my professor said—along with my friend’s enthusiasm—changed my mind. She said that if you don’t say it, we would 
        never know what you have in mind. Shortly after she said that, my friend and I stood up and presented our 
        explanation. 
    </p>
    <p>Gladly, it went well without any further confusion or question coming out of my professor. I felt relieved but 
        the effect of what my professor just said didn’t end there. I continued thinking of it for a while—including now. 
        Such words hit me kind of deeper than it should have. I see myself as a fairly closed person who doesn’t share 
        what’s in her head a lot. It’s like I think about a wide range of stuff but hardly express any. Meanwhile, 
        deep down inside, I do want people to know what’s going on in my head. So, hearing what my professor said 
        felt like a sign for me to open up a bit. Apparently, there are words which better be said even though I 
        plan to hold onto my principle of not sharing too much. Moreover, I’ve found it suffocating to stay silent 
        while having a million words in my head.
