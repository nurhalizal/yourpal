    <p>I recently made a commitment to write this biweekly series consistently. As I don’t want to be run out of ideas to 
        write—or forget the ones that once come to me—I’ve been taking notes on moments, insights or words I consider worth 
        writing. Taking notes actually work—even more than I expected. By the time I started writing this one, I got to 
        contemplate about which one to write. So, for now, I’m going with the one that captures the spirit of ‘Words Worth 
        Keeping’ the most.
    </p>
    <p>I got this one from another lecture—the same one as my first piece of this series. Turns out, a lecture/class is 
        really a place full of wisdom. In the middle of my Nuclear Physics class, my lecturer mentioned a discovery which 
        scientists back then thought as a bit ‘strange’. At this point, I just completely tuned into the on the physics 
        explanation, until I heard his next few words. He then continued by saying, that it seemed strange only because 
        they were still lack of understanding about it. I was like, “Oh yeah…! That makes so much sense!” As I can recall, 
        he kind of emphasized those words again by repeating them. Hearing that, I reached my phone straight away to take 
        a short note of the words. 
    </p>
    <p>Come to think of it, this saying relates way too much in our life, not just in the context of science. I believe we 
        have bumped into several moments where we thought to ourselves, “Why is it like that? Why do they do that?” Several 
        things could seem to be nonsense simply because we don’t get a grasp about it just yet. As a physics student, my 
        Physics of Everyday Wonder series is a list of suitable examples for this. Those things I talk about in there were 
        once ‘strange’ to me too. But as I gained some understandings of them, they start to be completely logical.
    </p>
    <p>In order to give more general example, how about we dive into how this quote echoes with our daily life as a social 
        human being. We must have been familiar with a situation where we witness an odd behaviour of another person. Like, 
        when you saw a friend being completely silent even when the whole room is noisy. Then, a thought came to your head, 
        “Why does she/he act that way? Doesn’t she/he know how to have fun with friends. We’re all chatting here and she/he’s 
        silent.” But beyond their silence, they might just be in the middle of something we don’t understand. Evidently, 
        this quote also leads us to another saying, “not to judge things too quickly”.
    </p>
    <p>My personal elaboration of this quote doesn’t stop here, by the way. I also think that it resonates with the notion 
        that we value things based on what we know about them. I’ve heard this simple analogy, probably even more than once; 
        if you hand a diamond and a banana to a monkey, without missing a beat it will grab the banana and ignore the diamond. 
        This could be a brilliant case to reflect how lack of knowledge of things may lead us to misjudge them. Had the monkey 
        known how much the diamond can worth and they actually could use it—the banana would’ve looked like a rubbish compared 
        to the diamond. Although, have someone ever actually offered a diamond to a monkey?
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, the point is; from what my lecturer said about things can look strange because we lack the grasp of it to how 
        our knowledge of things can influence how we value them—all of it shows how important the idea of ‘knowing’ is. 
        Therefore, to understand more about this life, we need to think and learn through it. Just like how scientists study 
        and do research to understand how things work which eventually benefit all of us.
