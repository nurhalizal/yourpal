  <section class="article-full">
    <p>Just earlier today, something unbelievably silly happened to me. Well, it’s a part of my clumsiness as well. I was 
        in a room with my friends, discussing something with a lecturer. Then I got a phone call so I went out of the room 
        and sat outside. The room was on the third floor and has a balcony-like design at some parts. So, from the place I 
        was sitting on, we could see what’s around the building outside—and could also look down to the ground-level area. 
    </p>
    <p>It’s complicated for me to explain the setting, but long story short, I got a little busy communicating through my 
        phone and decided to fix my sitting position to be more relaxed. Hence, I lifted one of my legs to put it on top 
        of the other. Unfortunately, I probably lifted it too high that my shoe left my foot. Yes, as I lifted it, I saw 
        my shoe flew before my eyes. I wish I could catch it—but nope, I didn’t get the chance to—and my shoe already 
        reached the ground. A moment later, I went downstairs to take it—and I found the shoe in a good position—still 
        sole-side down! 
    </p>
    <p>This reminded me of a video I watched where people tossed their shoes and always landed sole-side down. Well, I 
        believe anything in this physical world can be explained using physics. So, let’s explore the physics behind it. 
        In physics, we’re introduced to the concept of center of mass. This concept applies to any objects, from as enormous 
        as the universe-level to as tiny as the particle-level. So, everyday objects are no exception to this.
    </p>
    <p>Every object we use in our day-to-day life—each has its own center of mass—including shoes. Oh wait, I haven’t defined 
        what the center of mass is. The center of mass is a point at the center of the mass distribution of an object where 
        sum of weighed position of vectors equals zero. Yeah, this definition sounds complicated. So, I’m used to think about 
        it this way; center of mass is the balanced point of an object. It’s like the unique point that can balance the mass 
        of the entire object. The center of mass of an object affects the motion of the object significantly. In kinematics, 
        the center of mass is considered the point where all the mass is consentrated. Thus, the exact point position of an 
        object is determined by its center of mass. When an object falls, the object falls/moves as if its mass were concentrated 
        at the center of mass.
    </p>
    <p>In the falling shoe case, we have to consider the center of mass of the shoe. The sole of a shoe normally has higher 
        mass density than the upper part, hence the center of mass of the shoes is likely at a certain midpoint of the sole. 
        As a consequence, when the shoe falls—either after being tossed or just free-falling—the center of mass will behave 
        as the center of gravity as well. This leads to the center of mass being highly accelerated due to gravity. That’s 
        why when a shoe falls, it always lands sole-side down; the center of mass is in its sole. Besides, the sole part is 
        also denser than the upper part. If given the chance to, denser ‘object’ tends to run beneath the ‘object’ with less 
        density. This occurrence can also be related to stability. The shoe always lands sole-side down to reach the stable 
        or balanced position.
    </p>
    <p>I guess that’s all the explanation I can give about this and I know there’s even more complicated concepts behind this. 
        Even something as simple (and silly) as a falling shoe obey a rather complicated laws of physics.
