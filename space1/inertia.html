    <p>When you’re on a speeding vehicle then it suddenly stopped, you must have a second of thinking, 
        “Oh no, I’m falling forward.” That kind of experience could get us holding our breath for seconds 
        and even feel like our hearts almost dropped. But, do you ever wonder why such things always happen? 
        Like, why do our body move forward when the vehicle—whatever kind it is—actually stops? Some of you 
        might have imagined like, can our body just become stationary when the vehicle is stopping? That idea 
        obviously sounds preferable. However, it’s likely impossible. Even if it is possible, that would only 
        occur at a certain condition that are totally different from the ones we all have experienced.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, curious people would need an explanation about this ‘phenomenon’. I suppose the only way to 
        explain this is using physics. The one term to describe this, is inertia—the first Newton’s Law of motion. 
        But what is inertia? Inertia is the tendency of an object to stay the way it is in terms of motion states. 
        That means every object naturally resists changes to its state of motion. To change the motion state of an object, 
        external force is required. Without being affected by external force, an object will always remain in its current 
        state of motion; either it is stationary or is moving in a constant velocity. Now you’re probably thinking of 
        simple occurrence where this law doesn’t seem to be obeyed. Like when you roll a ball on a clean surface and 
        nothing is ahead of its rolling path, but it’ll still stop at some points. If we just think it that way, 
        we’ll surely think it disobeys the law. But not at all, without us noticing, the surface must give a certain 
        friction to the ball’s movement which is also the reason why it’s rolling instead of just sliding. So, there is, 
        an external force: the friction. 
    </p>
    <p>Now, let’s get back to our first example. When we’re on a vehicle, as the engine starts and the vehicle moves, 
        our body will start moving as well—following the vehicle’s state of motion. When the vehicle is stopped, that means 
        a force is applied to the vehicle to stop it (possibly by creating enough friction). However, our body doesn’t get 
        affected directly by the stopping force. Hence, even if the vehicle has stopped, we will still experience inertia—which 
        makes our body keeps moving forward just like it was moments before the vehicle stopped. To put it simply, every 
        object tends to stay either stationary or constantly moving unless it’s given external force. During a sudden vehicle 
        stop, our body will naturally maintain its current state of motion which was moving forward with the vehicle until 
        it’s eventually get enough stopping force from the vehicle stopping act and our own body control.
    </p>
    <p>Now, what do you think? I personally think it’s simple and complicated at the same time, but also fascinating. 
        To me, it’s another thing that shows how wonderful this world was made.
