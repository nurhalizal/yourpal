  <section class="article-full">
    <p> A few days ago, a friend of mine sent a photo of the moon in the sky to our group chat in the early morning. 
        She probably wondered, why do we see the moon during the day? It also reminded me to a Facebook post I saw years 
        ago when I was probably still a ten-year-old or around that age. It’s a father posting a moon photo during the 
        day and in the caption, he said that his daughter asked about why there’s a moon during the day. I’ve forgotten 
        the rest of the post, but that post left me in wonder as well, I suppose. 
    </p>
    <p>Years later, I think I’ve got the answer to that wonder. So, when I saw the photo my friend sent a few days ago, 
        I wasn’t confused anymore. This time, I will share about what I’ve got to learn about ‘seeing the moon during the 
        day’ thing.
    </p>
    <p>Actually, I’ve also just come to realize that the moon is visible during the daytime almost every day—except during 
        the new moon and full moon phases. But, do not expect to see the moon every day for the entire daytime. That’s 
        just not the case. Like the sun, the moon also has its rising and setting time. Yet unlike the sun—which average 
        rise and set time shift is relatively small—the shift of moon’s rise and set time is much higher. The moon’s rise 
        and set shift in a cycle that is affected by the moon’s orbit around the earth and the earth’s rotation. Therefore, 
        the moon’s rise and set time change over time in a monthly cycle—following its orbital motion around the earth. To 
        make it easier, we can relate the moon’s rise and set time to its phases. 
    </p>
    <p>Generally, there are eight phases of the moon; new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, 
        waning gibbous, third quarter, and waning crescent. If we talk about the moon phases relatively to the sun’s rise 
        and set time, there are phases when the moon is above the horizon during the day—either rising after sunrise or 
        setting before sunset—making it visible in the daytime sky. I understand that the moon is always associated with 
        the night sky. 
    </p>
    <p>This notion perhaps is the reason why some of us naturally think that the moon is only visible during nighttime. 
        However, it turns out not to be true. We basically can see the moon while being lit by the sunshine almost every 
        single day. Well, except during new moon as the moon is barely visible at all and during full moon because the 
        moon rises as the sun sets and sets as the sun rises. Other than that, you can always expect to see the moon in 
        the blue sky—even in various phases; crescent, half-moon, and gibbous. 
    </p>
    <p>By the way, if you love watching sunrise and sunset, you might want to watch the moonrise too, especially during 
        wanning gibbous phase. It’s beautiful!
