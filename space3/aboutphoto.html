    <p>This very photo is also my phone's lockscreen, a long lasting one. 
        It's like that one picture has been one of the icons of my gadgets. 
        Yes, not just my phone, but my laptop as well. The lockscreen is a picture 
        of a charming sunset. The picture was taken from a hotel rooftop, a few years ago. 
        If June 25th 2019 was a Tuesday, I’m confident that the picture was taken that day. 
        That one picture shows the city view of my hometown from a certain height. Well, just
        the typical view you’d see from a rooftop. Basically, lots of buildings with various 
        heights. As it was taken from a rooftop--especially during a sunset—the photo also shows 
        silhouette of buildings from a far. Those buildings view cover about one third of the photo. 
        Meanwhile, the other upper part shows you the view of the sky. The sky in the picture has a 
        perfect blue-orange gradation. So, the middle part of the photo—separating the city view and 
        the blue sky—is a stroke of orange color from the sunset. At one point along the orange stroke, 
        the glow of the sun becomes the center of attention. Most sunset pictures I have don’t really 
        show the sun itself; the main view is usually the orange effect of the sky. However, 
        in the lockscreen picture of mine, you can clearly see the sun—even almost in the perfect 
        circle shape. Originally, it’s a landscape photo and the sun is slightly on the left side 
        of the photo. But as my phone’s lockscreen, I arranged the cropped area so that the sun is 
        right in the center of the screen. So, whenever I turn my phone on, the beautiful sunset greets 
        me warmly.
