    <p>Thinking of… a conversation I wish I had made my mind wander at first. I enjoy imagining things and that includes 
        conversation. I have a whole lot of conversation scenarios in my head. Therefore, I may have lots of options when 
        talking about wishful conversations. However, when it comes to a conversation that I wish I had, I suppose I need 
        to narrow my options down to the conversations which are about impossible to happen. So, I have decided to write 
        about this one. Pieces of this longed conversation of mine have come to my head bunch of times, sometimes even at 
        weird times.
    </p>
    <p>This kind of conversation often occurs in my head when I’m alone, day dreaming, or when I’m with a bunch of friends 
        (especially the bunch she’s included), or when I’m just casually doing my things. Other than those times, this very 
        same date always brings me back to the thought of her, and conversations with her. The day I’m writing this is the 
        same date as the last day I could possibly have a normal conversation with her.
    </p>
    <p>So, here’s what I wished I could say to her now, my dear friend: <i>“Hello, don’t you wanna know how I am doing 
        right now? I’m doing great and it thanks to you too! First of all, I must say sorry, a thousand sorrys. I have no 
        idea how many mistakes I have made to you. I know we’re fine, but still I’ve got lots of mistakes. So, I’m sorry. 
        I think I’ve mistaken you at times, I’ve probably made wrong assumptions about you, did wrong things to you, and many 
        more. I am truly sorry about everything. Besides, I am also thankful for everything about you.”</i>
    </p>
    <p>Yeah, I wish I could get a reply from her, directly. Like, I imagine her saying things like, <i>“Hey, I knew 
        you’re doing fine”</i> or like, <i>“Everything’s fine between us, no need to worry”</i>. I also wish she’d add, 
        <i>“What have you been up to lately?”</i> and there are many other things I wish I could hear as a reply. Then I’d 
        continue talking from my side:
    </p>
    <p><i>“I’ve been through quite a lot, by the way. High school was awesome and I’m having fun in college. I’m studying 
        a subject that you probably had predicted, hehe. Again, although I’m still around my starting line, thanks to you 
        I made it here. You’re one of the reasons behind my studying motivation. Back then, you kept me on the book during 
        the times I would have been locked on social media and games. See, I have way too much to tell you, and thank you. 
        Oh yeah, not just me, our fellows are doing great too. We’re certainly on different paths (as expected), but at the 
        end of the day, I believe we all know we have each other. So don’t you worry about us.”</i>
    </p>
    <p>I wish I can say all those to her. I’d be so excited to know what she’d have in mind about everything. There are even 
        more stories I would tell. Some people would probably wonder why I hold this whole wishful conversation dearly. 
        Hmm…, she’s a dear friend of mine, that can’t ever be replaced. But, as much as I wish I could meet her in this world 
        again—at the end of the day it occurs to me to think; at the very least, I need to be thankful that I believe she’s 
        peaceful now. On the other hand, I am also exceptionally thankful for the opportunity to know her, be a part of her 
        story, be as close to her. Even though I don’t have the chance of new conversations, and I lost my old conversations 
        with her, the memories of her and conversations with her are all still here-in my head, and heart.
