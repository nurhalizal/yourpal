    <p>I was born in a family of Muslims in an Islamic majority country—in fact, my country has the biggest Muslim population. 
      Thus, I basically have been experiencing Hari Raya or Eid since I was born. Well, ‘since I was born’ probably is not 
      entirely true, ‘cause I don’t remember anything about it during my early years of life. However, I’ve celebrated Hari 
      Raya a lot too. Ever since I can remember, every Hari Raya has always been an extremely exciting day. I bet I’m not 
      the only one who feels the excitement every year. Every muslim in the whole world is exciting to celebrate Hari Raya 
      every year. But, what does Hari Raya mean to us?
    </p>
    <p>Now that I think of it, I just realized that the meaning of Raya, personally for me, has changed over time. Then I 
      suppose it does change for every one too. As little kids, we only had very little understanding about it. We might 
      see it as merely a day to wake up early, get all dressed up, then go to the mosque and other places. Then, as we 
      grew a little older, we’d realize that it’s the time of the year when we could gather ‘round with family members 
      we don’t see frequently. Around that age, we would wait for Hari Raya to meet our cousins, nieces, nephews so that 
      we could play along. Besides, there’s also a tradition where older family members especially the ones who are 
      financially well give others (especially kids), what we call as ‘raya money’. When kids have grown a little older, 
      like during elementary school years, they’d be delighted to receive the money. Obviously, the change doesn’t stop 
      there. 
    </p>
    <p>As the time passes by, kids become teenager, hence the meaning of everything, including Hari Raya eventually changes 
      again. As teenagers, we might still see it as the day to get along with family and friends, but the meaning gets 
      deeper. Supposedly, teenagers begin to understand the religious value of Hari Raya as well as the sharing of joy 
      side of it. Meanwhile, when it comes to our minds as adults, we’ll begin to perceive Hari Raya as a day to get 
      prepared for. Aside from the other values I’ve mentioned, when Hari Raya’s coming, adults will also think about the 
      cleaning, the cooking, welcoming guests, and probably other extra chores. So yeah, adults will probably need to 
      prepare their stamina and good health for Hari Raya, haha.
    </p>
    <p>At the end, I believe the older we get, some new values of Hari Raya add up to within our hearts and minds. Not to 
      say we might lose some meanings about it we used to have as kids.
