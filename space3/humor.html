    <p> I am not sure about what it means to have a great sense of humor. But if that means one has the ability to 
        appreciate jokes or easily find things amusing—then yes, I do have a great sense of humor. Yet I still think 
        humor is a complicated abstract noun. Perhaps, there are numerous types of humor and I’m sure enough that not 
        all of that I can find amusing. I guess I’ve seen/watched things that were supposed to be funny but I can’t 
        even smile at it simply because I don’t relate with the type of humor.
    </p>
    <p>However, if we talk about basic humor, or at least the everyday type we find in everyday interaction and 
        communication, I’m kind of way too easy to be amused. I’m also convinced that I can understand jokes easily 
        at times! Sorry, if that sounded too confident, hehe. So, basically, I easily laugh and even sometimes way 
        too easy. I also have big laughter that I’ve been scolded for laughing lots of times or at least being told 
        to lower my voice down when laughing in public spaces. Various types of things can make me laugh. Small jokes 
        said by my friends, unintended funny things, memes, and many more. Not just that, sometimes I almost burst 
        into laughters due to eavesdropping others’ conversation, haha. And it’s always been difficlut for me to 
        hold my laughter. One time, I almost choked on my food or drink because someone suddenly made a joke while 
        I’m swallowing things. So yeah, I basically laugh very easily, and I love laughters! I even have the believe 
        that there’ll always be things to laugh at every single day. 
    </p>
    <p>Oh yeah, before closing this piece, I almost forgot. As extra explanation to illustrate my sense of humor, 
        here’s two more things to describe my sense of humor. First, I would likely burst into laughters just by 
        remembering funny things that has happened before even if the moment has long gone. Besides, I sometimes 
        laugh or at least giggle just because others around me are laughing at things that I don’t even understand. 
        Every now and then, I do think of this behaviour of mine as both reasonable and quirky at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>But regardless, having this sense of humor is one of my ways of enjoying every moment.
