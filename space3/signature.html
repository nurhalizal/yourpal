    <p>I’m not sure how long did it take, but I certainly know that I’ve had the same signature for a 
        long time. It has not always been exactly the same. There are few differences between my current 
        signature compared to the first version of it. My signature is a simple one. Not to mention it 
        looks childish even to me sometimes. But there’s no wonder why a signature looks childish if 
        indeed it’s owned by a child, haha. Based on my memory, I came up with my signature in the middle 
        of elementary school, probably around the age of 9 to 11.
    </p>
    <p>If anyone take a look at my old notebooks, surely, you’ll find some signatures around, here and 
        there. Then if compared to my current one, they wouldn’t look that distinct. The signature is 
        just my initial with some added curves. It has always been like that ever since I was still an 
        elementary school student. I only made a little change by reducing some curves. Back then, I 
        thought that kind of change would make it look less childish. And now, I actually think that 
        modification worked well. Besides making it seem less childish (at least to me), it also has 
        made it easier for me to write my signature.
    </p>
    <p>To this day, I’ve used that signature for several things, my citizenship id, school stuffs, or 
        just scribbling on pieces of papers. Up till now, I still enjoy scribbling my signature on any 
        piece of paper, just as much as I liked to do that back then as a little kid. I have it in mind 
        that my signature is a part of my identity, just like my name.
