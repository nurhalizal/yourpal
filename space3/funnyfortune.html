  <section class="article-full">
    <p>It was a normal day in my classroom during our last year of high school. As it was our last high school year—which means 
        we’re graduating—we focused on where to go next after high school. Most of us planned to continue studying at universities. 
        To get accepted at universities, we most likely needed to pass a certain test. Thus, everyone was busy studying for that. 
        Many of my friends take a tutoring class or even more. Just as busy as the students were, tutoring institutions were also 
        busy promoting. So, our class was visited by several of them throughout our senior grade. 
    </p>
    <p>On that one day, another tutoring institution came to our class. But they didn’t directly jump on the promoting part, they 
        used a different approach. At the beginning, they asked two students of our class to come to the front of the class. Wonder 
        what for? To get tested with one or two questions. None of really wanted to come up. The people of the institutions even 
        came up with an idea to offer us money by saying, “If you get it right, this will be yours”. The offer didn’t work, though. 
        At last, I was one of the two who got “pushed” to go up. The position of my seat, which was in the front row also helped 
        that condition, I guess. I had no choice but to give up on my friends and go up along with a classmate whose seat was right 
        in the opposite of mine (front row as well).
    </p>
    <p>Then, we were given one question and each of us had to answer the question. Although I was in doubt, I did give an answer. 
        To our surprise, I got it correct! Later on, I realized that it was not as they had planned. Supposedly, we both were 
        expected to get it wrong, then they’d give explanation, give a question again then after we understood so we can answer 
        correctly. Then they’d say something like, “See, you all can get it right if explained in the right way first, etc. bla, 
        bla, bla.” 
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately for them, yet luckily for me, what happened was a bit different. And yeah, about the money they offered, 
        I came to think that they didn’t intend to really give it away, haha. But what choice did they have? I didn’t ask for 
        it, yet my friends might ask and judge them if they didn’t give it as they had promised before. At the end of the day, 
        I got a half of what they initially offered. It’s fine though, I got money by answering a single question—that's a win!
