    <p>It’s another morning in this public space. On one corner of that place, a tall sophisticated box stands firmly. 
        The box is filled with several snacks and drinks. It’s also built technologically advanced. It’s a vending machine! 
        Pretty early in the morning, someone already comes to wipe the box until it’s all clean and shiny. “Oh, hello there, 
        nice guy! You’ve come to wipe off the dust again. Thanks, by the way,” greets the machine silently. Now it’s ready 
        to encounter every other person who will come. 
    </p>
    <p>As the sun rises higher, the surrounding starts to become busier. 
        One by one person starts coming to the machine. A young girl comes standing in front of the machine, staring at 
        the choice of drinks there. She’s probably deciding what beverage should she use to kick start the day. The machine 
        gets bored waiting until the girl finally makes a choice. That kind of thing doesn’t happen only once or twice a day.
        It happens a lot. Many people come spending minutes just to pick a beverage from the machine. It’s like, if only the 
        machine could talk, it would gladly made the decision for them, haha.</p>
    <p>Then, as the days go by, in the afternoon, some people rush to the machine. Then start clicking the screen as quick as 
        possible. They sometimes look they don’t even have enough breath anymore and their lives rely on the machine. 
        When the can of fresh drink comes out of the machine, one like them will seem really relieved. The machine also 
        feels happy to help! But, if another way happens, where either the machine or they do something wrong, they will 
        be totally mad, and become thirstier, apparently. 
    </p>
    <p>Besides those early birds, the indecisive ones, and the rushed ones, there’s another type of people that the machine 
        is already used to meet. The curious ones. Especially around break time, some people came to the machine excitedly. 
        It’s not that they can’t wait to take something out of it, they are rather excited to try out the machine. They simply 
        enjoy clicking the machine then get something to digest out of it. What a random type of people! But I might be one of them.
    </p>
    <p>At the end of the day, if the machine were a person, it would learn that there are different types of people with different 
        behaviours and business. And all those can even be seen just by how they encounter a vending machine.
