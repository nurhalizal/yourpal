    <p>Apples… one interesting kind of fruit. I assume that it’s one of the most well-known fruits all over the world. 
        When you try to think of a fruit—unless you just ate another kind—I suppose apples will appear in your head first. 
        Now I’m trying to sort out the reasons why apples are so iconic. 
    </p>
    <p>First of all, I think the name has something to do with it. These very fruits are known as ‘apples’ in English—the 
        most spoken language in the world. Besides, some other languages have a similar word for apples. For instance, 
        in my language, Indonesian, the fruits are called ‘<i>apel</i>’. As these words started with an ‘A’—the first letter of the Latin alphabet—this kind of fruit is likely to come to our minds when we think of fruits. Now, I have a hypothesis that we tend to think alphabetically when it comes to random list of things, haha. 
    </p>
    <p>Well, the name isn’t the only reason, of course. I believe that the round-but-curved shape, especially with commonly 
        red color also affects its peculiarity. To me, the shape of apples kinda describe what it takes to be considered 
        fruits, and red is a striking color. Hence, apples become particularly memorable. This kinda brings us to the next 
        reason I can’t think of. The image of an apple is well-recognized possibly because the fruits’ worldwide growth. 
        Apples grow in many regions, so they’re basically known by all populations across the globe. 
    </p>
    <p>Then, besides the few reasons I’ve sorted out, I reckon that a religious or cultural exposure also plays a role in this. 
        In Abrahamic religions, we’re taught a story of Adam and Eve that involves a fruit—which is commonly said to resembles an apple. 
        This story even resulted the term, “Adam’s apple”. Anyway, people may have different opinion about all I’ve written here, 
        though.
    </p>
    <p>By the way, it’s already a long piece just talking about apples, isn’t it? But I still want to add a bit more. Other than 
        talking about Apples being an iconic type of fruits, I’mma share a personal ‘feeling’ on apples. Since I was very little, 
        I’ve always considered apples as my favorite type of fruits. I even have it written in my old binder notebook. 
        That sentence written about apple is also a proof of the beginning of my English learning. I suppose it’s one of my first 
        ever written english sentences. 
    </p>
    <p>Back to the apples, to this day, the sentence remains valid, apples are indeed one of my favorites. Furthermore, I personally 
        conclude that Apples might not be the king of fruits, but I suppose that they're the <i>icon</i> of the kingdom.
