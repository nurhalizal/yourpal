  </figure>
  <section class="article-full">
    <p>I have a vivid memory of my childhood where I used to try so hard just to escape from taking a nap. For some reason, 
        sleeping—which we all need—seemed so unlikeable to me in as a little kid. Especially, when we talk about taking a nap. 
        It was as if taking a nap was an extremely heavy job to do. I reckon it wasn’t just me. When I was a little kid, I 
        used to play a lot with my cousins and/or nieces/nephews who’re around my age. We could play from day to night every single 
        day. Playing together in the afternoon was one of the best things I could imagine doing at that time, meanwhile taking 
        a nap was seen as a big nightmare. 
    </p>
    <p>Back then, every afternoon, I would certainly be sent to take a nap by my mother. So, there were days that I used 
        to plead to skip naptime for the day. And if I recall correctly, at times, I even pretended to be asleep. Well, it 
        wasn’t easy to fall asleep when all’s in your head was playing. Therefore, whenever my mother ended up just letting 
        me skip naptime-which occurred every once in a while-it would be one of the biggest rewards I could think of.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, throwing back at my childhood, it seems rather silly to want to skip naptime. Apparently, as a little kid, 
        I didn’t care about saving energy and maintaining health at all. Probably, there’s no ordinary kid would care, tho. 
        Spending as much time being awake and playing all the time seemed super exciting back then. Then, growing up, I’ve 
        started to think like, “Why did I hate taking a nap, back then?” I can’t blame the little me, though. She just wasn’t 
        aware of bigger things just yet. Didn’t even know much she’d value taking some rest in the future, haha. I guess I’m not 
        that much of a busy person these days, yet some rest still means a lot. I’m grateful for every enough rest time I have 
        every single day. Back then, the little me simply didn’t understand that myself needed that nap, that rest. Probably I 
        wasn’t even aware of being tired. Like, even when I was physically tired, my mind just didn’t know it yet, so it insisted 
        on spending more energy. After years, I’ve come to fully get the sense of the importance of taking some rest, including 
        some naptime.
    </p>
    <p>I guess, people like me—in the middle of an exhausting day that hasn’t been over but already craving some sleep—they would 
        go, “I wish I took more naps as a kid and save the energy for today.”
